# Use AppRun with Dapr

Welcome to the world of AppRun, microservices, CQRS, and Dapr.

* [Dapr](https://dapr.io) is a portable, serverless, event-driven runtime for building resilient, stateless, and stateful microservices.

We can connect AppRun events to Dapr PubSub through WebSockets to build microservices using CQRS, and Dapr.
