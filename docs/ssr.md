# Server-Side Rendering


AppRun is a front-end library for developing SPA. It also supports rendering the SPAs on the server-side, just like other frameworks. Furthermore, it also allows us to make existing traditional server-side rendered applications into SPAs. Thus, AppRun can make many existing applications built using the server-side model-view-control (MVC) architecture become SPAs quickly.

## SPA to SSR

AppRun is isomorphic/universal. AppRun components can render on the client-side and on the server-side using the AppRun server-side view engine.

Included in the [SSR AppRun application example](https://github.com/yysun/apprun-ssr), there are:

* The express.js server application (server.ts),
* The site layout (components/layout.tsx),
* The AppRun components (components/*.tsx)
* The client-side application (/public/spa.js).

You can run the application on @glitch, https://apprun-ssr.glitch.me.
