# Unit Testing

AppRun architecture is unit test-oriented. The three architectural parts _state_, _view_, and _update_ (event handlers) are decoupled. They are straightforward to test.

AppRun development environment includes the Jest framework. The convention to run the tests is to use the npm script:
```sh
npm run jest
```
We can also run the Jest testing interactive mode using the npm script:
```sh
npm test
```
Jest watches file changes and runs the test files only related to changed files. Jest also executes the tests in parallel. Therefore, it is very fast to execute the tests. The interactive way for us to define which tests to be executed during the watch mode.

## Types of Testing

There are two types of unit tests in the AppRun application.

1. Test the _events-states_ - publishing the events and asserting the states.
2. Test the _state-vdom_ - set the states and assert the VDOM output of the _view_ function.

## Create Tests using CLI

Creating unit tests could be tedious, but you can use the [AppRun Dev Tools](cli-in-console.md) to generate the tests.

First, include the CLI scripts in your HTML.

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/apprun@latest/dist/apprun-dev-tools.js"></script>
```

### Event-State Tests

Use the _**create-event-tests**_ command to create event-state tests.

### State-VDOM Tests

Use the _**create-state-tests (start|stop)**_ command to create state-view tests.
