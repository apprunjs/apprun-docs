# Strong Typing

AppRun is a JavaScript library for developing high-performance and reliable web applications using the elm inspired architecture, events, and components. You can write JavaScript code and use AppRun without strong typing. Strong typing is optional when using AppRun.

However, if you choose to use strong typing, AppRun ships with a type definition file, apprun.d.ts since the first release. You can use the type definition file for strong typing with TypeScript.
